abstract = {Superposed-epoch analysis is performed on magnetic field measurements from five GOES spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit during 63 high-speed stream-driven storms in 1995–2005. The field strength and the field stretching angle are examined as functions of time and local time, and these quantities are compared with the properties of the solar wind, the plasma sheet, and the outer electron radiation belt. Compression of the dayside magnetosphere coincides with an increased solar wind ram pressure commencing before the arrival of the corotating interaction region (CIR). Stretching of the nightside magnetosphere occurs in two phases: a strong-stretching phase early in the storm followed by a modest-stretching phase lasting for days. The strong-stretching phase coincides with the occurrence of the superdense plasma sheet, implying that ion pressure causes the strong stretching. This nightside strong-stretching perturbation corresponds to a ∼25{\%} contribution to Dst*. The relativistic electron flux at geosynchronous orbit has a dropout recovery temporal profile that matches the strong-stretching temporal profile; however, the number density dropout and recovery of the electron radiation belt has a profile that leads the stretching profile. A comparison of geosynchronous field strengths and magnetopause field strengths indicates that magnetopause shadowing plays a role in the radiation belt dropout. Temporal fluctuations of the geosynchronous magnetic field are examined via 1 min changes of the GOES magnetic field vectors. Fluctuation amplitudes increase at all local times at storm onset and then slowly decay during the storms. The amplitude is linearly related to the Kp, PCI, and MBI indices, except during the strong-stretching phase of the storms.},

This period includes the recent solar minimum that occurred in September 1986. The dose is measured behind four thicknesses of aluminum shielding and for two thresholds of energy deposition, designated HILET and LOLET. An average dose per day is calculated for each month of satellite operation. It is found that the average proton (HILET) dose per day (obtained primarily in the inner belt) increased systematically from 1984 to 1987, and has a high anticorrelation with sunspot number when offset by 13 months. The average LOLET dose per day behind the thinnest shielding is produced almost entirely by outer zone electrons and varies greatly over the period of interest. If any trend can be discerned over the four year period it is a decreasing one. For shielding of 1.5 gm/cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (227 mil) Al or more, the LOLET dose is complicated by contributions from {\textgreater}100 MeV protons and bremsstrahlung},

abstract = {The outer radiation belt shows solar cycle variation: the L-shell of the electron flux peak in the outer belt shifts inward during the period between the rising phase and the solar maximum, while it shifts outward between the beginning of the declining phase and the solar minimum. We show a possible mechanism which considers two typical types of magnetic storms categorized in accordance with solar wind drivers, namely coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Large flux enhancements at the inner portion of the outer belt tend to occur during the recovery phase of great storms driven by CMEs, while large flux enhancements at the outer portion and at geosynchronous orbit tend to occur during the recovery phase of relatively moderate storms driven by CIRs. High-speed coronal hole streams which do not always cause large magnetic storms also effectively enhance the electron flux enhancement at the outer portion and in geosynchronous orbit. In this framework, the plasmapause always plays an important role in both flux enhancement and flux loss in the outer belt. The average plasmapause position depends on the storm amplitude, and the plasmapause reaches closest to the Earth during great storms driven by CMEs. CMEs themselves and CME-driven storms occur during maximum periods of solar activity, while CIRs themselves and CIR-driven storms occur during the solar declining phase. The observed long-term variations of the outer belt can therefore be understood in terms of their dependence on the large-scale interplanetary structures, varying depending on the phase of the solar cycle. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based upon the coherence, we then tested the feasibility of applying linear prediction filters to LEO data to predict the arrival of new MeV electrons during geomagnetic storms, as well as their evolving distributions afterward. Reliability of these predictive filters is quantified by the performance efficiency with values as high as 0.74 when driven merely by LEO observations (or up to 0.94 with the inclusion of in situ MeV electron measurements). Finally, a hypothesis based upon the wave-particle resonance theory is proposed to explain the coherence, and a first-principle electron tracing model yields supporting evidence.},

From our statistical results with the$\backslash$nfull database, the changes in the radial profile peak in PSD reveal$\backslash$nnotably consistent behavior with prior studies: 58{\%} of geomagnetic$\backslash$nstorms resulted in PSD peak enhancements, 17{\%} resulted in PSD peak$\backslash$ndepletions, and 25{\%} resulted in no significant change in the PSD peak$\backslash$nafter the storm. For the two case studies, we examined the PSD at$\backslash$nmultiple equatorial locations (using THEMIS), trapped and precipitating$\backslash$nfluxes from low-Earth orbit (using POES), and chorus, hiss, EMIC, and$\backslash$nULF waves (using THEMIS spacecraft, ground observatories, and the GOES$\backslash$nspacecraft). We show that (1) peaks in PSD were collocated with observed$\backslash$nchorus waves outside of the plasmapause during the most active periods$\backslash$nof the PSD-enhancing storm but not during the PSD-depleting storm,$\backslash$nproviding evidence for the importance of local acceleration by$\backslash$nwave-particle interactions with chorus; (2) outer belt dropouts occurred$\backslash$nfollowing solar wind pressure enhancements during both storms and were$\backslash$nconsistent with losses from magnetopause shadowing and subsequent$\backslash$noutward radial transport; during the PSD-enhancing storm, this revealed$\backslash$nhow the outer belt can replenish itself seemingly independently of the$\backslash$nremnant of the pre-existing belt leftover after a dropout, which in this$\backslash$ncase resulted in a double-peaked outer belt distribution; (3) slow decay$\backslash$nin PSD was associated with corresponding locations in L{\{}*{\}} and enhanced$\backslash$nwave amplitudes of plasmaspheric hiss; (4) precipitation loss associated$\backslash$nwith wave-particle interactions with hiss and EMIC waves appeared to be$\backslash$nsignificantly more important during the PSD-depleting storm than the$\backslash$nPSD-enhancing storm; and (5) PSD transport during the recovery phase of$\backslash$nboth storms and throughout the PSD-enhancing storm was consistent with$\backslash$nULF-wave-driven radial diffusion away from maxima in PSD; this indicates$\backslash$nthe importance of ULF waves in redistributing outer belt PSD after local$\backslash$nacceleration occurs.

abstract = {The heating rate of the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit is determined for the interval from 36 to 72 h after the onset of high-speed stream-driven storms. Multisatellite measurements of the radiation belt temperature are used for 93 high-speed stream-driven storms. During the storms, the outer electron radiation belt temperature changes from ∼120 keV to ∼190 keV. The average heating rate of 32 keV d−1 is obtained. The heating rate during the storms is found to be positively correlated with the solar wind velocity and with the Kp index of geomagnetic activity and to be negatively correlated with the solar wind number density. When the solar wind velocity is held fixed, the correlation of the heating rate with Kp vanishes. Expressions for the change in the heating rate as function of the solar wind speed, the solar wind density, and the Kp index are fit to the data. The heating rate is uncorrelated with the amplitude of magnetic field fluctuations in the magnetosphere. Correlations between the heating rate and the level of velocity, density, and magnetic field fluctuations in the magnetosphere and in the solar wind are weaker than the correlations of the heating rate with the solar wind velocity and density. The heating rates correspond to a kinetic energy density change of 3.6 × 10−11 erg cm−3 d−1 at geosynchronous orbit, to a specific entropy change of 4.1 × 106 eV cm2 d−1 at geosynchronous orbit, and to a total heating rate of the geosynchronous orbit region of 5.3 × 106 Watts. },

Density n and temperature T values are determined from relativistic Maxwellian fits to the electron measurements, enabling the specific entropy S to be calculated. For low temperatures the nonrelativstic specific entropy is S = T/n2/3; for a relativistic Maxwellian distribution a relativistically correct expression for S = S(T,n) is derived and used. The outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit local midnight (n ∼ 3 × 10−4 cm−3 and T ∼ 140 keV) and the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail (n ∼ 1 × 10−4 cm−3 and T ∼ 50 keV) statistically have the same specific entropy.

But physics-based models of radiation-belt dynamics require knowledge of the global distribution of chorus waves. We demonstrate that time-dependent, global distributions of near-equatorial chorus wave intensities can be inferred from low-Earth-orbit (LEO) measurements of precipitating low-energy electrons. We compare in situ observations of near-equatorial chorus waves with LEO observations of precipitating electrons and derive a heuristic formula that relates, quantitatively, electron precipitation fluxes to chorus wave intensities.

We analyzed 11-year variation in relativistic electron flux (E{\textgreater}2 MeV) at geosynchronous orbit using measurements made by GOES satellites during the 23rd sunspot cycle. As it is believed that electron flux enhancements are connected with the high-speed solar wind streams and ULF or/and VLF activity in the magnetosphere, we studied also solar cycle changes in rank order cross-correlation of the outer radiation belt electron flux with the solar wind speed and both interplanetary and on-ground wave intensity. Data from magnetometers and plasma sensors onboard the spacecraft ACE and WIND, as well as magnetic measurements at two mid-latitude diametrically opposite INTERMAGNET observatories were used. Results obtained show that average value of relativistic electron flux at the decay and minimum phases of solar activity is one order higher than the flux during maximum sunspot activity. Of all solar wind parameters, only solar wind speed variation has significant correlation with changes in relativistic electron flux, taking the lead over the latter by 2 days. Variations in ULF amplitude advance changes in electron flux by 3 days. Results of the above study may be of interest for model makers developing forecast algorithms. ?? 2013 IAA.},

abstract = {Bi-Maxwellian fits are made to energetic-electron flux measurements from seven satellites in geosynchronous orbit, yielding a number density (n) and temperature (T) description of the outer electron radiation belt. For 54.5 spacecraft years of measurements the median value of n is 3.7 104 cm3, and the median value of T is 148 keV. General statistical properties of n, T, and the 1.11.5 MeV flux F are investigated, including local-time and solar-cycle dependencies. Using superposed-epoch analysis where the zero epoch is convection onset, the evolution of the outer electron radiation belt through high-speed-stream-driven storms is investigated. The number-density decay during the calm before the storm, relativistic-electron dropouts and recoveries, and the heating of the outer electron radiation belt during storms are analyzed. Using four different triggers (sudden storm commencement (SSC), southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) portions of coronal mass ejection (CME) sheaths, southward-IMF portions of magnetic clouds, and minimum Dst) a selection of CME-driven storms are analyzed with superposed-epoch techniques. For CME-driven storms, only a very modest density decay prior to storm onset is found. In addition, the compression of the outer electron radiation belt at the time of SSC is analyzed, the number-density increase and temperature decrease during storm main phase are characterized, and the increase in density and temperature during storm recovery phase is determined. During the different phases of storms, changes in the flux are sometimes in response to changes in the temperature, sometimes to changes in the number density, and sometimes to changes in both. Differences are found between the density-temperature and flux descriptions, and it is concluded that more information is available using the density-temperature description.},

abstract = {Google Scholar is one of the major academic search engines but its ranking algorithm for academic articles is unknown. We performed the first steps to reverse-engineering Google Scholar's ranking algorithm and present the results in this research-in-progress paper. The results are: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Therefore, highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that have been cited less often. As a consequence, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for finding standard literature than gems or articles by authors advancing a new or different view from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. Moreover, the occurrence of a search term in an article's title seems to have a strong impact on the article's ranking. The impact of search term frequencies in an article's full text is weak. That means it makes no difference in an article's ranking if the article contains the query terms only once or multiple times. It was further researched whether the name of an author or journal has an impact on the ranking and whether differences exist between the ranking algorithms of different search modes that Google Scholar offers. The answer in both of these cases was "yes". The results of our research may help authors to optimize their articles for Google Scholar and enable researchers to estimate the usefulness of Google Scholar with respect to their search intention and hence the need to use further academic search engines or databases.},

abstract = {Radiation shielding analysis is a crucial process in the spacecraft and space instrument development cycle. Simple tools such as SHIELDOSE-2 are used traditionally. With advances in computer and network technology and in energetic particle transport simulation codes, detailed Monte Carlo (M-C) simulation is no longer an approach reserved for research scientists but is widely becoming an important engineering tool. In this paper, we report on the main features of the multilayered shielding simulation software tool (MULASSIS) developed as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) activities in the Geant4 collaboration. It is based on the Geant4 M-C simulation toolkit developed by a large international collaboration lead by CERN. The software will be used as a general tool within ESA for radiation fluence, dose, and effects analysis. It has been integrated into the ESA SPENVIS system, thus, making it accessible to the wider space community over the World Wide Web.},

abstract = {The Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope Integrated Little Experiment (REPTile) is a loaded-disc collimated solid-state particle telescope designed, built, tested, and operated by a team of students at the University of Colorado. It was launched onboard the Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE), a 3U CubeSat, from Vandenberg Air Force Base on September 13th, 2012, as part of NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program. REPTile takes measurements of energetic particles in the near-Earth environment. These measurements, by themselves and in conjunction with larger missions, are critical to understand, model, and predict hazardous space weather effects. However, miniaturizing a power- and mass-hungry particle telescope to return clean measurements from a CubeSat platform is extremely challenging. To overcome these challenges, REPTile underwent a rigorous design and testing phase. This paper highlights some of the design and testing which validates the data as a valuable contribution to the study of space weather. CSSWE uses a keep-it-simple design approach to minimize risks associated with low budget and student built missions. A coherent testing plan confirmed that the spacecraft would remain healthy and take reliable measurements in orbit. This paper also highlights the system-level design and testing that verified spacecraft performance pre and post launch. Despite the risks inherent CubeSat missions, REPTile to date has returned over 300 days of valuable science data, more than tripling its nominal mission lifetime of 90 days. Initial in-flight instrument results are presented, including engineering hurdles encountered in receiving and processing the data. Also, the preliminary scientific contributions of the mission are covered in this paper to demonstrate the capabilities of a low-budget CubeSat mission. As an affordable, robust, and simple instrument and mission design, CSSWE demonstrates that small satellites are a reliable p- atform to deliver quality science.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the modeling of local acceleration and loss processes in the outer radiation belt. We begin by reviewing the statistical properties of waves that violate the first and second adiabatic invariants, leading to the loss and acceleration of high energy electrons in the outer radiation belt. After a brief description of the most commonly accepted methodology for computing quasi-linear diffusion coefficients, we present pitch-angle scattering simulations by (i) plasmaspheric hiss, (ii) a combination of plasmaspheric hiss and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, (iii) chorus waves, and (iv) a combination of chorus and EMIC waves. Simulations of the local acceleration and loss processes show that statistically, the net effect of chorus waves is acceleration at MeV energies and loss at hundreds of keV energies. The combination of three-dimensional (3D) simulations of the local processes and radial transport show that the complexity of the behavior of the radiation belts is due to a number of competing processes of acceleration and loss, and depends on the dynamics of the plasmasphere, ring current, and solar wind conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-series (GOES-R) is the next block of four satellites to follow the existing GOES constellation currently operating over the Western Hemisphere. Advanced spacecraft and instrument technology will support expanded detection of environmental phenomena, resulting in more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings. Advancements over current GOES capabilities include a new capability for total lightning detection (cloud and cloud-to-ground flashes) from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), and improved cloud and moisture imagery with the 16-channel Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). The GLM will map total lightning activity continuously day and night with near-uniform storm-scale spatial resolution of 8. km with a product refresh rate of less than 20. s over the Americas and adjacent oceanic regions in the western hemisphere. This will aid in forecasting severe storms and tornado activity, and convective weather impacts on aviation safety and efficiency. In parallel with the instrument development, an Algorithm Working Group (AWG) Lightning Detection Science and Applications Team developed the Level 2 (stroke and flash) algorithms from the Level 1 lightning event (pixel level) data. Proxy data sets used to develop the GLM operational algorithms as well as cal/val performance monitoring tools were derived from the NASA Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) instruments in low Earth orbit, and from ground-based lightning networks and intensive prelaunch field campaigns. The GLM will produce the same or similar lightning flash attributes provided by the LIS and OTD, and thus extend their combined climatology over the western hemisphere into the coming decades. Science and application development along with preoperational product demonstrations and evaluations at NWS forecast offices and NOAA testbeds will prepare the forecasters to use GLM as soon as possible after the planned launch and checkout of GOES-R in late 2015. New applications will use GLM alone, in combination with the ABI, or integrated (fused) with other available tools (weather radar and ground strike networks, nowcasting systems, mesoscale analysis, and numerical weather prediction models) in the hands of the forecaster responsible for issuing more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings. ?? 2013.},

                        6Li(n, T)?? reaction were used to measure neutrons of energies {\textless}1 MeV. Fission foil neutron detectors were used to measure neutrons of energies above 1 MeV. While originally analysed in terms of dose equivalent using the NCRP-38 definition of quality factor, for the purposes of this paper the measured neutron data have been reanalyzed and are presented in terms of ambient dose equivalent. Dose equivalent rate for neutrons {\textless}1 MeV ranged from 0.80 ??Sv/d on the low altitude, low inclination STS-41B mission to 22.0 ??Sv/d measured in the Shuttle's cargo bay on the highly inclined STS-51F Spacelab-2 mission. In one particular instance a detector embedded within a large hydrogenous mass on STS-61 (in the ECT experiment) measured 34.6 ??Sv/d. Dose equivalent rate measurements of neutrons {\textgreater}1 MeV ranged from 4.5 ??Sv/d on the low altitude STS-3 mission to 172 ??Sv/d on the ???6 year LDEF mission. Thermal neutrons ({\textless}0.3 eV) were observed to make a negligible contribution to neutron dose equivalent in all cases. The major fraction of neutron dose equivalent was found to be from neutrons {\textgreater}1 MeV and, on LDEF, neutrons {\textgreater}1 MeV are responsible for over 98{\%} of the total neutron dose equivalent. Estimates of the neutron contribution to the total dose equivalent are somewhat lower than model estimates, ranging from 5.7{\%} at a location under low shielding on LDEF to 18.4{\%} on the highly inclined (82.3??)

The calculations take into account secondary neutron, proton, and charged pion production from the ambient galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) proton, trapped proton, and neutron albedo environments. Comparisons of the predicted neutron spectra with measurments made on the Mir space station and other spacecraft have also been made (Armstrong and Colborn, 1998). In this paper, some initial results from folding the predicted neutron spectrum inside ISS modules from Armstrong and Colborn (1998) with several types of radiation effects response functions related to electronics damage and astronaut-dose are given. These results provide an estimate of the practical importance of neutrons compared to protons in assessing radiation effects for the ISS. Also, the important neutron energy ranges for producing these effects have been estimated, which provides guidance for onboard neutron measurement requirements.},

Also, fission foils are used to detect fast neutrons. In the second method, fast neutrons are recorded by nuclear photographic emulsions (NPE). The results of measurements on board various satellites are presented. The neutron flux density does not appear to correlate clearly with orbital parameters. Up to 50{\%} of neutrons are due to albedo neutrons from the atmosphere while the fluxes inside the satellites are 15-20{\%} higher than those on the outside.

abstract = {Instruments and methods recently used for space radiation dosimetry are reviewed for the purposes of comparison and reference. Passive detection methods mentioned include track-etch, luminescent, nuclear emulsion, and metal foil detectors. These can provide a reliable source of data for all types of radiation, but often require processing that cannot occur in space. Experimental methods of LET determination using TLDs, such as the high temperature peak ratio (HTR) method, are also discussed. Portable readout passive detectors including Pille, MOSFET, and bubble detector systems provide a novel alternative to traditional passive detectors, but research is more limited and their widespread use has yet to be established. Active detectors including DOSTEL, CPDS, RRMD-III, TEPC, R-16, BBND, and the Liulin series are examined for technical details. These instruments allow the determination of dose in real-time, and some can determine LET of incident particles by measuring energy deposition over a known path-length, but size and power consumption limit their practical use for dosimetry. Improved neutron dosimetry and development of a small active or portable readout personnel dosimeter capable of accurate LET determination are important steps for managing the effects of long-term exposure to the space radiation environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 COSPAR.

During the mission on the external URM-D platform of the Zvezda service module, samples of eight international astrobiology experiments selected by ESA and one Russian guest experiment were exposed to low Earth orbit space parameters from March 10th, 2009 to January 21st, 2011. EXPOSE-R accommodated a total of 1220 samples for exposure to selected space conditions and combinations, including space vacuum, temperature cycles through 273 K, cosmic radiation, solar electromagnetic radiation at {\textgreater}110, {\textgreater}170 or {\textgreater}200 nm at various fluences up to GJ m−2. Samples ranged from chemical compounds via unicellular organisms and multicellular mosquito larvae and seeds to passive radiation dosimeters. Additionally, one active radiation measurement instrument was accommodated on EXPOSE-R and commanded from ground in accordance with the facility itself. Data on ultraviolet radiation, cosmic radiation and temperature were measured every 10 s and downlinked by telemetry and data carrier every few months. The EXPOSE-R trays and samples returned to Earth on March 9th, 2011 with Shuttle flight, Space Transportation System (STS)-133/ULF 5, Discovery, after successful total mission duration of 27 months in space. The samples were analysed in the individual investigators laboratories.

abstract = {Context: The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) has been measuring the radiation environment on the surface of Mars since August 6th 2012. MSL-RAD is the first instrument to provide detailed information about charged and neutral particle spectra and dose rates on the Martian surface, and one of the primary objectives of the RAD investigation is to help improve and validate current radiation transport models. Aims: Applying different numerical transport models with boundary conditions derived from the MSL-RAD environment the goal of this work was to both provide predictions for the particle spectra and the radiation exposure on the Martian surface comple-menting the RAD sensitive range and, at the same time, validate the results with the experimental data, where applicable. Such validated models can be used to predict dose rates for future manned missions as well as for performing shield optimization studies. Methods: Several particle transport models (GEANT4, PHITS, HZETRN/OLTARIS) were used to predict the particle flux and the corresponding radiation environment caused by galactic cosmic radiation on Mars. From the calculated particle spectra the dose rates on the surface are estimated. Results: Calculations of particle spectra and dose rates induced by galactic cosmic radiation on the Martian surface are presented. Although good agreement is found in many cases for the different transport codes, GEANT4, PHITS, and HZETRN/OLTARIS, some models still show large, sometimes order of magnitude discrepancies in certain particle spectra. We have found that RAD data is helping to make better choices of input parameters and physical models. Elements of these validated models can be applied to more detailed studies on how the radiation environment is influenced by solar modulation, Martian atmosphere and soil, and changes due to the Martian seasonal pressure cycle. By extending the range of the calculated particle spectra with respect to the experimental data additional information about the radiation environment is gained, and the contribution of different particle species to the dose is estimated.},

So far the active personal dosimeters are not available and the best passive personal dosimeters currently applied to the radiation assessment for astronauts are CR-39 detectors (for the high LET part) in combination with thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs) or optically stimulated luminescence detectors) (OSLDs) (for the low LET part).

abstract = {The radiation field in low Earth orbit (LEO) and deep space is complicated. The radiation impact on astronauts depends strongly on the particles' linear energy transfer (LET) and is dominated by high LET radiation. Radiation risk is a key concern for human space flight and can be estimated with radiation LET spectra measured for the different organs of an astronaut phantom. At present the best passive personal dosimeters used for astronauts are thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) for low LET and CR-39 plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) for high LET. CR-39 PNTDs, TLDs and OSLDs were used for the MATROSHKA-1 experiment to measure radiation experienced by astronauts outside the international space station (ISS). LET spectra and radiation field quantities (differential and integral fluence, absorbed dose and dose equivalent) were measured for the different organs and skin locations of the MAROSHKA phantom using CR-39 PNTDs and TLDs. The spectra and results can be used to determine the radiation quantities for astronaut's extra vehicular activity (EVA) and for the further in-depth study of the radiation risk for astronauts. Sensitivity fading of CR-39 detectors was observed for the MATROSHKA experiment and a practical method was developed to correct it. This paper presents the radiation LET spectra measured with CR-39 PNTDs and the total radiation quantities combined from results measured with CR-39 PNTDs and TLDs.},

Because of a higher inclination of the SL-1 orbit (57?? versus 28.5?? for previous shuttle flights), substantial fluxes of highly ionizing HZE particles were also observed, yielding an overall average mission dose-equivalent of about 135 millirem, about three times higher than measured on previous shuttle missions.

We performed the first steps to reverse-engineering Google Scholar's ranking algorithm and present the results in this research-in-progress paper. The results are: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Therefore, highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that have been cited less often. As a consequence, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for finding standard literature than gems or articles by authors advancing a new or different view from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. Moreover, the occurrence of a search term in an article's title seems to have a strong impact on the article's ranking. The impact of search term frequencies in an article's full text is weak. That means it makes no difference in an article's ranking if the article contains the query terms only once or multiple times. It was further researched whether the name of an author or journal has an impact on the ranking and whether differences exist between the ranking algorithms of different search modes that Google Scholar offers. The answer in both of these cases was "yes". The results of our research may help authors to optimize their articles for Google Scholar and enable researchers to estimate the usefulness of Google Scholar with respect to their search intention and hence the need to use further academic search engines or databases.},

The objective was to find out how mind maps are structured and which information they contain. Results include: A typical mind map is rather small, with 31 nodes on average (median), whereas each node usually contains between one to three words. In 66.12{\%} of cases there are few notes, if any, and the number of hyperlinks tends to be rather low, too, but depends upon the mind mapping application. Most mind maps are edited only on one (60.76{\%}) or two days (18.41{\%}). A typical user creates around 2.7 mind maps (mean) a year. However, there are exceptions which create a long tail. One user created 243 mind maps, the largest mind map contained 52,182 nodes, one node contained 7,497 words and one mind map was edited on 142 days.},

abstract = {Google Scholar is one of the major academic search engines but its ranking algorithm for academic articles is unknown. We performed the first steps to reverse-engineering Google Scholar's ranking algorithm and present the results in this research-in-progress paper. The results are: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Therefore, highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that have been cited less often. As a consequence, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for finding standard literature than gems or articles by authors advancing a new or different view from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. Moreover, the occurrence of a search term in an article's title seems to have a strong impact on the article's ranking. The impact of search term frequencies in an article's full text is weak. That means it makes no difference in an article's ranking if the article contains the query terms only once or multiple times. It was further researched whether the name of an author or journal has an impact on the ranking and whether differences exist between the ranking algorithms of different search modes that Google Scholar offers. The answer in both of these cases was "yes". The results of our research may help authors to optimize their articles for Google Scholar and enable researchers to estimate the usefulness of Google Scholar with respect to their search intention and hence the need to use further academic search engines or databases.},

abstract = {In many physics experiments where calorimeters are employed, the requirement of an accurate energy measurement is accompanied by the requirement of very high hadronelectron discrimination power. Normally the latter requirement is achieved by designing a high-granularity detector with sufficient depth so that the showers can fully develop. This method has many drawbacks ranging from the high number of electronic channels to the high mass of the detector itself. Some of these drawbacks may in fact severely limit the deployment of such a detector in many experiments, most notably in space-based ones. Another method, proposed by our group and currently under investigation, relies on the use of scintillation detectors which are sensitive to the neutron component of the hadron showers. Here a review of the current status will be presented starting with the simulations performed both with GEANT4 and FLUKA. A small prototype detector has been built and has been tested in a high-energy pion/electron beam behind a "shallow" calorimeter. Results are encouraging and indicate that it is possible to enhance the discrimination power of an existing calorimeter by the addition of a small-mass neutron detector, thus paving the way for better performing astroparticle experiments. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.
