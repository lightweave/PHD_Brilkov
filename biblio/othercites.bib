Here, shell corrections calculated with hydrogenic wave functions have been employed. By using experimental atomic energy levels as parameters for them, I have found good agreement between experimental and calculated values of stopping power for elements with atomic number Z {\&} 56. Only for the mean ionization energy I there was no simple relation to atomic properties, and a considerable dependence of the Bloch parameter 5 = I/Z on Z hes been found. Calculated values of stopping power and ranges agree with experimental values for protons with kinetic energies T above G.5 MeV, for ions (with z protons and M {\&} 40 nucleons) above T/M {\~{}} (z—1.5) MeV, well within the uncertainty of the experiments, but an approximately 1{\%} discrepancy for several hundred MeV protons remains.},

abstract = {We consider in a classical formulation the interaction of a particle of charge Z1e incident at a given impact parameter with an electron bound isotropically and harmonically to the origin with a frequency $\omega$. Using a perturbation expansion that assumes that the displacement of the bound electron is small compared to the impact parameter, and integrating over the impact parameter from some minimum value to infinity, we are led to an expression for the stopping power. The leading term in this expansion is proportional to (Z1e2)2 and is the usual result for this type of model, while the second term gives us the (Z1e2)3 correction. The Z13 correction for the Lenz-Jensen statistical model for the atom is presented. The predictions of this theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.},

abstract = {Research indicates that the impact to human tissues from radiation exposure is strongly related to the LET (linear energy transfer) of the particles and particles with high LET (≥ 5 KeV / $\mu$ m water) dominate the damage. High LET radiation in LEO (low Earth orbit) is composed mainly of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), solar energetic particles, particles trapped in the SAA (South Atlantic Anomaly), and albedo neutrons and protons scattered from the Earth's atmosphere. So far the active personal dosimeters are not available and the best passive personal dosimeters currently applied to the radiation assessment for astronauts are CR-39 detectors (for the high LET part) in combination with thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs) or optically stimulated luminescence detectors) (OSLDs) (for the low LET part). LET spectra for radiation in LEO were determined with CR-39. This paper introduces the operational principles for CR-39 detectors, describes the method of LET spectrum using CR-39 and presents the results measured with CR-39 and TEPC (tissue equivalent proportional counter) for space mission ISS-Expedition 2, STS-108, STS-112, ISS-7S, STS-114 and STS-121.},

abstract = {The radiation field in low Earth orbit (LEO) and deep space is complicated. The radiation impact on astronauts depends strongly on the particles' linear energy transfer (LET) and is dominated by high LET radiation. Radiation risk is a key concern for human space flight and can be estimated with radiation LET spectra measured for the different organs of an astronaut phantom. At present the best passive personal dosimeters used for astronauts are thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) for low LET and CR-39 plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) for high LET. CR-39 PNTDs, TLDs and OSLDs were used for the MATROSHKA-1 experiment to measure radiation experienced by astronauts outside the international space station (ISS). LET spectra and radiation field quantities (differential and integral fluence, absorbed dose and dose equivalent) were measured for the different organs and skin locations of the MAROSHKA phantom using CR-39 PNTDs and TLDs. The spectra and results can be used to determine the radiation quantities for astronaut's extra vehicular activity (EVA) and for the further in-depth study of the radiation risk for astronauts. Sensitivity fading of CR-39 detectors was observed for the MATROSHKA experiment and a practical method was developed to correct it. This paper presents the radiation LET spectra measured with CR-39 PNTDs and the total radiation quantities combined from results measured with CR-39 PNTDs and TLDs.},

abstract = {The Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML) is a specialized XML-based language designed as an application-independent persistent format for describing the geometries of detectors associated with physics measurements. It serves to implement "geometry trees" which correspond to the hierarchy of volumes a detector geometry can be composed of, and to allow to identify the position of individual solids, as well as to describe the materials they are made of. Being pure XML, GDML can be universally used, and in particular it can be considered as the format for interchanging geometries among different applications. In this paper we will present the current status of the development of GDML. After having discussed the contents of the latest GDML schema, which is the basic definition of the format, we will concentrate on the GDML processors. We will present the latest implementation of the GDML "writers" as well as "readers" for either Geant4 , or ROOT ,},

abstract = {Neutron measurement results obtained at SINP MSU since 1970 are presented. These measurements were made using techniques based on neutron moderation and subsequent detection in a Li6I(Eu) crystal or a He3 coronal counter. The measurements were mainly carried out in orbits with inclination of 52?? and altitudes of 200-450 km. The spatial and angular distributions of the measured neutron fluxes were studied. The albedo neutron flux was estimated according to the count rate difference for opposite detector orientations towards Earth and away from it. This flux is comparable to the local neutron flux outside the Brazil anomaly region, where local neutrons dominate. Neutron fluxes, generated by solar protons, were detected during a solar flare on June 6, 1991 for the first time. Their spectrum was estimated as a power law with ?? {\textgreater} 2. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Measurements of radiation exposures aboard manned space flights of various altitudes, orbital inclinations and durations were performed by means of passive radiation detectors, thermoluminescent detectors (TLD's), and in some cases by active electronic counters. The TLD's and electronic counters covered the lower portion of the LET (linear energy transfer) spectra, while the nuclear track detectors measured high-LET produced by HZE particles. In Spacelab (SL-1), TLD's recorded a range of 102 to 190 millirad, yielding an average low-LET dose rate of 11.2 mrad per day inside the module, about twice the dose rate measured on previous space shuttle flights. Because of a higher inclination of the SL-1 orbit (57?? versus 28.5?? for previous shuttle flights), substantial fluxes of highly ionizing HZE particles were also observed, yielding an overall average mission dose-equivalent of about 135 millirem, about three times higher than measured on previous shuttle missions. A dose rate more than an order of magnitude higher than for any other space shuttle flight was obtained for mission STS-41C, reflecting the highest orbital altitude to date of 519 km. ?? 1984.},

Outside CERN, among various applications worldwide, FLUKA serves as a core tool for the HIT and CNAO hadron-therapy facilities in Europe. Therefore, medical applications further impose stringent requirements in terms of reliability and predictive power, which demands constant refinement of sophisticated nuclear models and continuous code improvement.

We performed the first steps to reverse-engineering Google Scholar's ranking algorithm and present the results in this research-in-progress paper. The results are: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Therefore, highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that have been cited less often. As a consequence, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for finding standard literature than gems or articles by authors advancing a new or different view from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. Moreover, the occurrence of a search term in an article's title seems to have a strong impact on the article's ranking. The impact of search term frequencies in an article's full text is weak. That means it makes no difference in an article's ranking if the article contains the query terms only once or multiple times. It was further researched whether the name of an author or journal has an impact on the ranking and whether differences exist between the ranking algorithms of different search modes that Google Scholar offers. The answer in both of these cases was "yes". The results of our research may help authors to optimize their articles for Google Scholar and enable researchers to estimate the usefulness of Google Scholar with respect to their search intention and hence the need to use further academic search engines or databases.},

abstract = {The results presented in this paper come from an exploratory study of 19,379 mind maps created by 11,179 users from the mind mapping applications ‘Docear' and ‘MindMeister'. The objective was to find out how mind maps are structured and which information they contain. Results include: A typical mind map is rather small, with 31 nodes on average (median), whereas each node usually contains between one to three words. In 66.12{\%} of cases there are few notes, if any, and the number of hyperlinks tends to be rather low, too, but depends upon the mind mapping application. Most mind maps are edited only on one (60.76{\%}) or two days (18.41{\%}). A typical user creates around 2.7 mind maps (mean) a year. However, there are exceptions which create a long tail. One user created 243 mind maps, the largest mind map contained 52,182 nodes, one node contained 7,497 words and one mind map was edited on 142 days.},

@article{Adriani2011,
abstract = {In many physics experiments where calorimeters are employed, the requirement of an accurate energy measurement is accompanied by the requirement of very high hadronelectron discrimination power. Normally the latter requirement is achieved by designing a high-granularity detector with sufficient depth so that the showers can fully develop. This method has many drawbacks ranging from the high number of electronic channels to the high mass of the detector itself. Some of these drawbacks may in fact severely limit the deployment of such a detector in many experiments, most notably in space-based ones. Another method, proposed by our group and currently under investigation, relies on the use of scintillation detectors which are sensitive to the neutron component of the hadron showers. Here a review of the current status will be presented starting with the simulations performed both with GEANT4 and FLUKA. A small prototype detector has been built and has been tested in a high-energy pion/electron beam behind a "shallow" calorimeter. Results are encouraging and indicate that it is possible to enhance the discrimination power of an existing calorimeter by the addition of a small-mass neutron detector, thus paving the way for better performing astroparticle experiments. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.
