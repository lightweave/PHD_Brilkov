abstract = {The Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML) is a specialized XML-based language designed as an application-independent persistent format for describing the geometries of detectors associated with physics measurements. It serves to implement "geometry trees" which correspond to the hierarchy of volumes a detector geometry can be composed of, and to allow to identify the position of individual solids, as well as to describe the materials they are made of. Being pure XML, GDML can be universally used, and in particular it can be considered as the format for interchanging geometries among different applications. In this paper we will present the current status of the development of GDML. After having discussed the contents of the latest GDML schema, which is the basic definition of the format, we will concentrate on the GDML processors. We will present the latest implementation of the GDML "writers" as well as "readers" for either Geant4 , or ROOT ,},

abstract = {Google Scholar is one of the major academic search engines but its ranking algorithm for academic articles is unknown. We performed the first steps to reverse-engineering Google Scholar's ranking algorithm and present the results in this research-in-progress paper. The results are: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Therefore, highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that have been cited less often. As a consequence, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for finding standard literature than gems or articles by authors advancing a new or different view from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. Moreover, the occurrence of a search term in an article's title seems to have a strong impact on the article's ranking. The impact of search term frequencies in an article's full text is weak. That means it makes no difference in an article's ranking if the article contains the query terms only once or multiple times. It was further researched whether the name of an author or journal has an impact on the ranking and whether differences exist between the ranking algorithms of different search modes that Google Scholar offers. The answer in both of these cases was "yes". The results of our research may help authors to optimize their articles for Google Scholar and enable researchers to estimate the usefulness of Google Scholar with respect to their search intention and hence the need to use further academic search engines or databases.},

Results include: A typical mind map is rather small, with 31 nodes on average (median), whereas each node usually contains between one to three words. In 66.12{\%} of cases there are few notes, if any, and the number of hyperlinks tends to be rather low, too, but depends upon the mind mapping application. Most mind maps are edited only on one (60.76{\%}) or two days (18.41{\%}). A typical user creates around 2.7 mind maps (mean) a year. However, there are exceptions which create a long tail. One user created 243 mind maps, the largest mind map contained 52,182 nodes, one node contained 7,497 words and one mind map was edited on 142 days.},

abstract = {In many physics experiments where calorimeters are employed, the requirement of an accurate energy measurement is accompanied by the requirement of very high hadronelectron discrimination power. Normally the latter requirement is achieved by designing a high-granularity detector with sufficient depth so that the showers can fully develop. This method has many drawbacks ranging from the high number of electronic channels to the high mass of the detector itself. Some of these drawbacks may in fact severely limit the deployment of such a detector in many experiments, most notably in space-based ones. Another method, proposed by our group and currently under investigation, relies on the use of scintillation detectors which are sensitive to the neutron component of the hadron showers. Here a review of the current status will be presented starting with the simulations performed both with GEANT4 and FLUKA. A small prototype detector has been built and has been tested in a high-energy pion/electron beam behind a "shallow" calorimeter. Results are encouraging and indicate that it is possible to enhance the discrimination power of an existing calorimeter by the addition of a small-mass neutron detector, thus paving the way for better performing astroparticle experiments. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.
