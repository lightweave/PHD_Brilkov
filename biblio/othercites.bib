abstract = {The paper presents observation of relativistic electrons. Data are collected by the Radiation Risk Radiometer-Dosimeters (R3D) B2/B3 modifications during the flights of Foton M2/M3 satellites in 2005 and 2007 as well as by the R3DE instrument at the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) on the Columbus External Payload Adaptor at the International Space Station (ISS) in the period February 20 - April 28, 2008. On the Foton M2/M3 satellites relativistic electrons are observed more frequently than on the ISS because of higher (62.8??) inclination of the orbit. At both Foton satellites the usual duration of the observations are a few minutes long. On the ISS the duration usually is about 1 min or less. The places of observations of high doses due to relativistic electrons are distributed mainly at latitudes above 50?? geographic latitude in both hemispheres on Foton M2/M3 satellites. A very high maximum is found in the southern hemisphere at longitudinal range 0??-60??E. At the ISS the maximums are observed between 45?? and 52?? geographic latitude in both hemispheres mainly at longitudes equatorward from the magnetic poles. The measured absolute maximums of dose rates generated by relativistic electrons are found to be as follows: 304 ??Gy h-1 behind 1.75 g cm-2 shielding at Foton M2, 2314 ??Gy h-1 behind 0.71 g cm-2 shielding at Foton M3 and 19,195 ??Gy h-1 (Flux is 8363 cm-2 s-1) behind les than 0.4 g cm-2 shielding at ISS. ?? 2009 COSPAR.},

abstract = {The International Space Station (ISS) is now a reality with the start of a permanent human presence on board. Radiation presents a serious risk to the health and safety of the astronauts, and there is a clear requirement for estimating their exposures prior to and after flights. Predictions of the dose rate at times other than solar minimum or solar maximum have not been possible, because there has been no method to calculate the trapped-particle spectrum at intermediate times. Over the last few years, a tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) has been flown at a fixed mid-deck location on board the Space Shuttle in 51.65 degrees inclination flights. These flights have provided data that cover the expected changes in the dose rates due to changes in altitude and changes in solar activity from the solar minimum to the solar maximum of the current 23rd solar cycle. Based on these data, a simple function of the solar deceleration potential has been derived that can be used to predict the galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) dose rates to within +/-10{\%}. For altitudes to be covered by the ISS, the dose rate due to the trapped particles is found to be a power-law function, rho(-2/3), of the atmospheric density, rho. This relationship can be used to predict trapped dose rates inside these spacecraft to +/-10{\%} throughout the solar cycle. Thus, given the shielding distribution for a location inside the Space Shuttle or inside an ISS module, this approach can be used to predict the combined GCR + trapped dose rate to better than +/-15{\%} for quiet solar conditions.},

abstract = {The tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC)-based dosemeters used on the International Space Station have exceeded their planned useful lives, and are scheduled to be replaced with the new units taking advantage of improved technology. The original TEPC detectors used cylindrical geometry with field tubes to achieve good energy resolution and minimum sensitivity to noise created by vibration. The inside diameter of these detectors is 5.1 cm. The new detectors developed for this appli- cation produce the resolution and vibration resistance of the cylindrical detector with the isotropic response and compact size of a spherical detector. The cathode structure consists of conductive tissue-equivalent plastic A-150 layers separated by thin polyethylene layers perpendicular to the anode. Each conductive layer is held at the electrical potential needed to produce uniform electric field strength along the anode wire, and thus the same gas gain for electrons produced in different portions of the spherical volume. The new design contains the whole preamplifier inside the vacuum chamber to reduce electronic noise. Also the vacuum chamber has a novel design with a 0.020-inch-thick aluminium wall to allow a total wall thickness of 0.5 g cm22, which is typical of the shielding provided by a space suit. This feature will allow measuring the dose on the astronauts' skin due to low-energy electrons and protons produced during solar events. The vacuum chamber has a new bayonet clamping system that reduces the total detector weight to less than half that of the old TEPC.},

The HZETRN program is intended specifically for the design engineer who is interested in obtaining fast and accurate dosimetric information for the design and construction of space modules and devices. The program is based on a one-dimensional space-marching formulation of the Boltzmann transport equation with a straight-ahead approximation. The effect of the long-range Coulomb force and electron interaction is treated as a continuous slowing-down process. Atomic (electronic) stopping power coefficients with energies above a few A MeV are calculated by using Bethe's theory including Bragg's rule, Ziegler's shell corrections, and effective charge. Nuclear absorption cross sections are obtained from fits to quantum calculations and total cross sections are obtained with a Ramsauer formalism. Nuclear fragmentation cross sections are calculated with a semiempirical abrasion-ablation fragmentation model. The relation of the final computer code to the Boltzmann equation is discussed in the context of simplifying assumptions. A detailed description of the flow of the computer code, input requirements, sample output, and compatibility requirements for non-VAX platforms are provided.},

The dosimeter system is utilized for routine and extravehicular activity (EVA) individual dosimetry of astronauts/cosmonauts as part of the service system as well as for on board experiments, and is operated by the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP). The system is unique in that it regularly provides accurate dose data right on board the space station, a feature that became increasingly important during the suspension of the Space Shuttle flights. Seven dosimeters are located at different places of the Russian segment of the ISS and are read out once a month. Two of these dosimeters are dedicated to EVAs and one is kept in the reader and will be read out automatically every 90 min. During coronal mass ejections impacting Earth some of the dosimeters serve for individual monitoring of the astronauts with readouts once or twice every day. In this paper we report the results of dosimetric measurements made on board the ISS during Expedition-8, -9 and -10 using the "Pille" portable thermoluminescent detector (TLD) system and we compare them with our previous measurements on different space stations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The coupling of the Van Allen radiation belts to the Earth's atmosphere through precipitating particles is an area of intense scientific interest. Currently, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the precipitating characteristics of medium energy electrons ({\textgreater} 20 keV), and even more uncertainties for relativistic electrons. In this paper we examine roughly 10 years of measurements of trapped and precipitating electrons available from the Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES)/Space Environment Monitor (SEM-2), which has provided long-term global data in this energy range. We show that the POES SEM-2 detectors suffer from some contamination issues that complicate the understanding of the measurements, but that the observations provide insight into the precipitation of energetic electrons from the radiation belts, and may be developed into a useful climatology for medium energy electrons. Electron contamination also allows POES/SEM-2 to provide unintended observations of {\textgreater} 700 keV relativistic electrons. Finally, there is an energy-dependent time delay observed in the POES/SEM-2 observations, with the relativistic electron enhancement (electrons {\textgreater} 800 keV) delayed by approximately one week relative to the {\textgreater} 30 keV electron enhancement, probably due to the timescales of the acceleration processes. Observations of trapped relativistic electron fluxes near the geomagnetic equator by GOES show similar delays, indicating a "coherency" to the radiation belts at high and low orbits, and also a strong link between trapped and precipitating particle fluxes. Such large delays should have consequences for the timing of the atmospheric impact of geomagnetic storms.},

abstract = {Energetic electrons are deposited into the atmosphere from Earth's inner magnetosphere, resulting in the production of odd nitrogen (NOx). During polar night, NOx can be transported to low altitudes, where it can destroy ozone, affecting the atmospheric radiation balance. Since the flux of energetic electrons trapped in the magnetosphere is related to solar activity, the precipitation of these electrons into Earth's atmosphere provides a link between solar variability and changes in atmospheric chemistry which may affect Earth's climate. To determine the global distribution of the precipitating flux, we have built a statistical model binned by auroral electrojet (AE) index, magnetic local time (MLT), and L shell of E {\textgreater} 30 keV precipitating electrons from the Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED) on board the NOAA Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) low‐altitude satellites NOAA‐15, NOAA‐16, NOAA‐17, and NOAA‐18. We show that the precipitating flux increases with geomagnetic activity, suggesting that the flux is related to substorm activity. The precipitating fluxes maximize during active conditions where they are primarily seen outside of the plasmapause on the dawnside. The global distribution of the precipitating flux of E {\textgreater} 30 keV electrons is well‐correlated with the global distribution of lower‐band chorus waves as observed by the plasma wave experiment onboard the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) satellite. In addition, the electron precipitation occurs where the pitch angle diffusion coefficient due to resonant interaction between electrons and whistler mode chorus waves is high, as calculated using the pitch angle and energy diffusion of ions and electrons (PADIE) code. Our results suggest that lower‐band chorus is very important for scattering {\textgreater}30 keV electrons from Earth's inner magnetosphere into the atmosphere. Citation: Lam, M. M., R. B. Horne, N.

abstract = {Development of HZE particle transport codes is severely required for the shielding design of spacecrafts. One-dimensional deterministic codes are generally adopted in the shielding calculation because of their reasonable computational time, but three-dimensional Monte Carlo codes are also to be employed especially in the final step of the design with fully optimized geometries. We are therefore developing a general-purpose Monte Carlo code PHITS, which can deal with the transports of all kinds of hadrons and heavy ions with energies up to 200 GeV / n. For the purpose of examining the applicability of PHITS to the shielding design, neutron and charged particle spectra inside the Space Shuttle were calculated for an imaginary vessel whose shielding distribution is fitted to that of the real shuttle. Absorbed doses and dose equivalents were estimated from the spectra by applying fluence to dose conversion coefficients. The agreements between the calculated spectra or doses and the corresponding experimental data were generally satisfactory, especially for the neutron spectra, which have been barely reproduced by other studies. We therefore concluded that PHITS has a great possibility of playing an important role in the design study of spacecrafts. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The apparatus is comprised of a time-of-flight system, a silicon-microstrip magnetic spectrometer, a silicon-tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter, an anticoincidence system, a shower tail counter scintillator and a neutron detector. The combination of these devices allows precision studies of the charged cosmic radiation to be conducted over a wide energy range (100 MeV to 100's GeV) with high statistics. The primary scientific goal is the measurement of the antiproton and positron energy spectra in order to search for exotic sources, such as dark matter particle annihilations. PAMELA is also searching for primordial antinuclei (anti-helium), and testing cosmic-ray propagation models through precise measurements of the antiparticle energy spectrum and precision studies of light nuclei and their isotopes. Moreover, PAMELA is investigating phenomena connected with solar and earth physics. After 4 years of operation in flight, PAMELA is now delivering coherent results about spectra and chemical composition of the charged cosmic radiation, allowing scenarios of production and propagation of cosmic rays to be fully established and understood. {\textcopyright} 2011 COSPAR.

abstract = {The controlled production of single photons is of fundamental and practical interest; they represent the lowest excited quantum states of the radiation field, and have applications in quantum cryptography and quantum information processing. Common approaches use the fluorescence of single ions, single molecules, colour centres and semiconductor quantum dots. However, the lack of control over such irreversible emission processes precludes the use of these sources in applications (such as quantum networks) that require coherent exchange of quantum states between atoms and photons. The necessary control may be achieved in principle in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although this approach has been used for the production of single photons from atoms, such experiments are compromised by limited trapping times, fluctuating atom-field coupling and multi-atom effects. Here we demonstrate a single-photon source based on a strongly localized single ion in an optical cavity. The ion is optimally coupled to a well-defined field mode, resulting in the generation of single-photon pulses with precisely defined shape and timing. We have confirmed the suppression of two-photon events up to the limit imposed by fluctuations in the rate of detector dark counts. The stream of emitted photons is uninterrupted over the storage time of the ion, as demonstrated by a measurement of photon correlations over 90 min.},

Although effective, these detectors are limited in efficiency (the case for boron and LiF coatings) or in the ability to distinguish background radiations from neutron-induced interactions (the case for Gd coatings). Over the past decade, a renewed effort has been made to improve diode designs to achieve up to a 10-fold increase in neutron detection efficiency over the simple planar diode designs. These new semiconductor neutron detectors are fashioned with a matrix of microstructured patterns etched deeply into the substrate and, subsequently, backfilled with neutron reactive materials.

Liulin-5 measures time resolved deposited energy spectra, linear energy transfer (LET) spectrum, flux and absorbed dose rates for electrons, protons and the biologically relevant heavy ion components of the cosmic radiation at three depths along the phantom's radius.We present some new results of Liulin-5 experiment obtained from June 2007 to March 2010.The average quality factor for different time intervals is between 2.7 and 4.4. Due to the heavy ions in LET spectrum of the galactic cosmic rays (GCR), the GCR quality factor is bigger than that of the trapped protons. The absorbed dose rates measured at depths in the phantom corresponding to the depths of blood forming organs in human body are 7.75-9.6. $\mu$Gy/h and the dose equivalent rates are 24.6-36.7. $\mu$Sv/h. Usually the trapped protons contribute about 60{\%} of the total absorbed dose at 40. mm depth in the phantom and about 40{\%} at 165. mm depth. The rest of the dose comes from GCR. Space Shuttle docking and the change of ISS attitude preformed for that purpose lead to a decrease in the total doses and to decreasing the trapped protons contributions. The doses from GCR are not affected neither by the depth of measurement not by Shuttle docking.At 165mm depth in the phantom the largest fluxes along the ISS orbit are obtained from the trapped protons in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) at L values 1.26-1.27, B{\~{}}0.198Gs, geographical longitude {\~{}}-51° to -55°, latitude {\~{}}-28° to -29° and altitudes 361-363km.

@techreport{Hoyt2007,
abstract = {Using analytical methods and numerical simulations, we investigated the feasibility of using long conducting structures charged to high voltages to remove energetic particles from the radiation belts of Earth and Jupiter. Both approaches indicate that such remediation is feasible, and the number and size of ‘ElectroStatic Radiation Belt Remediation' (ES-RBR) spacecraft required to reduce electron fluxes in the Earth's inner electron belt are both very reasonable. A system composed of 24 spacecraft, each of which has a 100-km long, 200-kg tether structure and a power supply on the order of 5 kW, could dramatically lower the radiation doses experienced by spacecraft and personnel flying in low Earth orbit. Investigation of the potential adverse ‘environmental impact' of such a radiation belt remediation effort indicate that the anticipated side effects on the ozone layer and RF communications will be very mild and short-lived, comparable to a very weak solar storm. Remediation of the Jovian radiation belts is a much more challenging proposition due to its immense spatial extent, but remediation of a narrow band around one of the Galilean moons, such as Europa, may be feasible with a system composed of 100 very high-voltage ES-RBR spacecraft. Because the models used in these analyses rely upon several assumptions regarding the very complex physics of the high-voltage sheaths that form around a multi-wire tether structure in the presence of a plasma, near-term efforts to advance the technology readiness of this concept should focus upon verification of these assumptions through detailed experimental investigation of the size and structure of plasma sheaths around multi-wire structures. Should these investigations validate the models, the ES-RBR concept can then be demonstrated through a relatively low-cost microsat-class flight experiment that would measure the precipitation of energetic electrons into the upper atmosphere caused by a several-kilometer long high-voltage tether structure. The high-voltage, high-power microsat hardware demonstrated in this flight could then serve as a flight-qualified building block for a modular architecture for constructing the two dozen 100-km long electrostatic structures required for an operational ES-RBR system. By dramatically reducing radiation fluxes in the LEO environment, such an ES-RBR system could enable satellites to be built using lower cost, higher performance components while still providing reliable operations on orbit, could enable reusable highperformance solar-electric propulsion tugs to survive repeated transits through the Van Allen belts, and could reduce health risks for manned spaceflight missions in LEO and beyond.},

The objective of the MATROSHKA-R project is to provide depth dose distribution of the radiation field inside the sphere in order to get more information on the distribution of dose in a human body. Liulin-5 is a charged particle telescope using three silicon detectors. It measures time resolved energy deposition spectra, linear energy transfer (LET) spectra, particle flux, and absorbed doses of electrons, protons and heavy ions, simultaneously at three depths along the radius of the phantom. Measurements during the minimum of the solar activity in cycle 23 show that the average absorbed daily doses at 40 mm depth in the phantom are between 180 ??Gy/day and 220 ??Gy/day. The absorbed doses at 165 mm depth in the phantom decrease by a factor of 1.6-1.8 compared to the doses at 40 mm depth due to the self-shielding of the phantom from trapped protons. The average dose equivalent at 40 mm depth is 590 ?? 32 ??SV/day and the galactic cosmic rays (GCR) contribute at least 70{\%} of the total dose equivalent at that depth.

abstract = {Earth's radiation belts, two doughnut-shaped regions of charged particles encircling our planet, were discovered more than 50 years ago, but their behavior is still not completely understood. Now, new observations from NASA's Van Allen Probes mission show that the fastest, most energetic electrons in the inner radiation belt are not present as much of the time as previously thought. The results are presented in a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research and show that there typically isn't as much radiation in the inner belt as previously assumed — good news for spacecraft flying in the region. Past space missions have not been able to distinguish electrons from high-energy protons in the inner radiation belt. But by using a special instrument, the Magnetic Electron and Ion Spectrometer — MagEIS — on the Van Allen Probes, the scientists could look at the particles separately for the first time. What they found was surprising —there are usually none of these super-fast electrons, known as relativistic electrons, in the inner belt, contrary to what scientists expected. “We've known for a long time that there are these really energetic protons in there, which can contaminate the measurements, but we've never had a good way to remove them from the measurements until now,” said Seth Claudepierre, lead author and Van Allen Probes scientist at the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California. Of the two radiation belts, scientists have long understood the outer belt to be the rowdy one. During intense geomagnetic storms, when charged particles from the sun hurtle across the solar system, the outer radiation belt pulsates dramatically, growing and shrinking in response to the pressure of the solar particles and magnetic field. Meanwhile, the inner belt maintains a steady position above Earth's surface. The new results, however, show the composition of the inner belt isn't as constant as scientists had assumed. Ordinarily, the inner belt is composed of high-energy protons and low-energy electrons. However, after a very strong geomagnetic storm in June 2015, relativistic electrons were pushed deep into the inner belt. The findings were visible because of the way MagEIS was designed. The instrument creates its own internal magnetic field, which allows it to sort particles based on their charge and energy. By separating the electrons from the protons, the scientists could understand which particles were contributing to the population of particles in the inner belt. “When we carefully process the data and remove the contamination, we can see things that we've never been able to see before,” said Claudepierre. “These results are totally changing the way we think about the radiation belt at these energies.”},

Estimation of space radiation effects on health requires the accurate knowledge of the accumulated absorbed dose, which depends on the global space radiation distribution, solar cycle and local shielding generated by the 3D mass distribution of the space vehicle. This paper presents an overview of the spectrometer-dosimeters of the Liulin type, which were developed in the late 1980s and have been in use since then. Two major measurement systems have been developed by our team. The first one is based on one silicon detector and is known as a Liulin-type deposited energy spectrometer (DES) (Dachev et al., 2002, 2003), while the second one is a dosimetric telescope (DT) with two or three silicon detectors. The Liulin-type instruments were calibrated using a number of radioactive sources and particle accelerators. The main results of the calibrations are presented in the paper.

abstract = {Superposed-epoch analysis is performed on magnetic field measurements from five GOES spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit during 63 high-speed stream-driven storms in 1995–2005. The field strength and the field stretching angle are examined as functions of time and local time, and these quantities are compared with the properties of the solar wind, the plasma sheet, and the outer electron radiation belt. Compression of the dayside magnetosphere coincides with an increased solar wind ram pressure commencing before the arrival of the corotating interaction region (CIR). Stretching of the nightside magnetosphere occurs in two phases: a strong-stretching phase early in the storm followed by a modest-stretching phase lasting for days. The strong-stretching phase coincides with the occurrence of the superdense plasma sheet, implying that ion pressure causes the strong stretching. This nightside strong-stretching perturbation corresponds to a ∼25{\%} contribution to Dst*. The relativistic electron flux at geosynchronous orbit has a dropout recovery temporal profile that matches the strong-stretching temporal profile; however, the number density dropout and recovery of the electron radiation belt has a profile that leads the stretching profile. A comparison of geosynchronous field strengths and magnetopause field strengths indicates that magnetopause shadowing plays a role in the radiation belt dropout. Temporal fluctuations of the geosynchronous magnetic field are examined via 1 min changes of the GOES magnetic field vectors. Fluctuation amplitudes increase at all local times at storm onset and then slowly decay during the storms. The amplitude is linearly related to the Kp, PCI, and MBI indices, except during the strong-stretching phase of the storms.},

abstract = {The authors use direct measurement of dose to show the variation in inner and outer radiation belt populations at low altitude from 1984 to 1987. This period includes the recent solar minimum that occurred in September 1986. The dose is measured behind four thicknesses of aluminum shielding and for two thresholds of energy deposition, designated HILET and LOLET. An average dose per day is calculated for each month of satellite operation. It is found that the average proton (HILET) dose per day (obtained primarily in the inner belt) increased systematically from 1984 to 1987, and has a high anticorrelation with sunspot number when offset by 13 months. The average LOLET dose per day behind the thinnest shielding is produced almost entirely by outer zone electrons and varies greatly over the period of interest. If any trend can be discerned over the four year period it is a decreasing one. For shielding of 1.5 gm/cm2 (227 mil) Al or more, the LOLET dose is complicated by contributions from {\textgreater}100 MeV protons and bremsstrahlung},

abstract = {The outer radiation belt shows solar cycle variation: the L-shell of the electron flux peak in the outer belt shifts inward during the period between the rising phase and the solar maximum, while it shifts outward between the beginning of the declining phase and the solar minimum. We show a possible mechanism which considers two typical types of magnetic storms categorized in accordance with solar wind drivers, namely coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Large flux enhancements at the inner portion of the outer belt tend to occur during the recovery phase of great storms driven by CMEs, while large flux enhancements at the outer portion and at geosynchronous orbit tend to occur during the recovery phase of relatively moderate storms driven by CIRs. High-speed coronal hole streams which do not always cause large magnetic storms also effectively enhance the electron flux enhancement at the outer portion and in geosynchronous orbit. In this framework, the plasmapause always plays an important role in both flux enhancement and flux loss in the outer belt. The average plasmapause position depends on the storm amplitude, and the plasmapause reaches closest to the Earth during great storms driven by CMEs. CMEs themselves and CME-driven storms occur during maximum periods of solar activity, while CIRs themselves and CIR-driven storms occur during the solar declining phase. The observed long-term variations of the outer belt can therefore be understood in terms of their dependence on the large-scale interplanetary structures, varying depending on the phase of the solar cycle. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We first report a high cross-energy, cross-pitch-angle coherence discovered between the trapped MeV electrons and precipitating approximately hundreds ({\~{}}100s) of keV electrons—observed by satellites with very different altitudes—with correlation coefficients as high as ≳0.85. Based upon the coherence, we then tested the feasibility of applying linear prediction filters to LEO data to predict the arrival of new MeV electrons during geomagnetic storms, as well as their evolving distributions afterward. Reliability of these predictive filters is quantified by the performance efficiency with values as high as 0.74 when driven merely by LEO observations (or up to 0.94 with the inclusion of in situ MeV electron measurements). Finally, a hypothesis based upon the wave-particle resonance theory is proposed to explain the coherence, and a first-principle electron tracing model yields supporting evidence.},

Two storms are studied in$\backslash$ndetail, selected from a database of 53 events (Dst(min){\textless}-40 nT) during$\backslash$nthe THEMIS era thus far (December 2007-August 2012). These storms are$\backslash$nwell covered by a number of in situ THEMIS spacecraft and complemented$\backslash$nby additional ground-based and in situ observatories, and they epitomize$\backslash$nthe divergent behaviors that the outer radiation belt electrons can$\backslash$nexhibit during active periods, even during otherwise similar Dst and$\backslash$nauroral electrojet (AE) profiles. From our statistical results with the$\backslash$nfull database, the changes in the radial profile peak in PSD reveal$\backslash$nnotably consistent behavior with prior studies: 58{\%} of geomagnetic$\backslash$nstorms resulted in PSD peak enhancements, 17{\%} resulted in PSD peak$\backslash$ndepletions, and 25{\%} resulted in no significant change in the PSD peak$\backslash$nafter the storm. For the two case studies, we examined the PSD at$\backslash$nmultiple equatorial locations (using THEMIS), trapped and precipitating$\backslash$nfluxes from low-Earth orbit (using POES), and chorus, hiss, EMIC, and$\backslash$nULF waves (using THEMIS spacecraft, ground observatories, and the GOES$\backslash$nspacecraft). We show that (1) peaks in PSD were collocated with observed$\backslash$nchorus waves outside of the plasmapause during the most active periods$\backslash$nof the PSD-enhancing storm but not during the PSD-depleting storm,$\backslash$nproviding evidence for the importance of local acceleration by$\backslash$nwave-particle interactions with chorus; (2) outer belt dropouts occurred$\backslash$nfollowing solar wind pressure enhancements during both storms and were$\backslash$nconsistent with losses from magnetopause shadowing and subsequent$\backslash$noutward radial transport; during the PSD-enhancing storm, this revealed$\backslash$nhow the outer belt can replenish itself seemingly independently of the$\backslash$nremnant of the pre-existing belt leftover after a dropout, which in this$\backslash$ncase resulted in a double-peaked outer belt distribution; (3) slow decay$\backslash$nin PSD was associated with corresponding locations in L{\{}*{\}} and enhanced$\backslash$nwave amplitudes of plasmaspheric hiss; (4) precipitation loss associated$\backslash$nwith wave-particle interactions with hiss and EMIC waves appeared to be$\backslash$nsignificantly more important during the PSD-depleting storm than the$\backslash$nPSD-enhancing storm; and (5) PSD transport during the recovery phase of$\backslash$nboth storms and throughout the PSD-enhancing storm was consistent with$\backslash$nULF-wave-driven radial diffusion away from maxima in PSD; this indicates$\backslash$nthe importance of ULF waves in redistributing outer belt PSD after local$\backslash$nacceleration occurs. We conclude that these source, transport, and loss$\backslash$nprocesses, individually well characterized by previous studies, do$\backslash$nindeed appear to act in concert, leading to predominance of local$\backslash$nacceleration in one case and loss in another. These processes can$\backslash$ntherefore conspire toward optimal source or loss of outer belt electrons$\backslash$nunder suitable external drivers, and the conditions resulting in wave$\backslash$ngrowth for these acceleration and loss mechanisms are therefore an$\backslash$nimportant area of future research.},

abstract = {The heating rate of the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit is determined for the interval from 36 to 72 h after the onset of high-speed stream-driven storms. Multisatellite measurements of the radiation belt temperature are used for 93 high-speed stream-driven storms. During the storms, the outer electron radiation belt temperature changes from ∼120 keV to ∼190 keV. The average heating rate of 32 keV d−1 is obtained. The heating rate during the storms is found to be positively correlated with the solar wind velocity and with the Kp index of geomagnetic activity and to be negatively correlated with the solar wind number density. When the solar wind velocity is held fixed, the correlation of the heating rate with Kp vanishes. Expressions for the change in the heating rate as function of the solar wind speed, the solar wind density, and the Kp index are fit to the data. The heating rate is uncorrelated with the amplitude of magnetic field fluctuations in the magnetosphere. Correlations between the heating rate and the level of velocity, density, and magnetic field fluctuations in the magnetosphere and in the solar wind are weaker than the correlations of the heating rate with the solar wind velocity and density. The heating rates correspond to a kinetic energy density change of 3.6 × 10−11 erg cm−3 d−1 at geosynchronous orbit, to a specific entropy change of 4.1 × 106 eV cm2 d−1 at geosynchronous orbit, and to a total heating rate of the geosynchronous orbit region of 5.3 × 106 Watts.},

The outer electron radiation belt is measured with the SOPA detectors on board six geosynchronous satellites and the energetic electrons of the magnetotail are measured with instrumentation on board 12 Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) with a magnetic field model used to map the GPS orbit to the magnetotail. Density n and temperature T values are determined from relativistic Maxwellian fits to the electron measurements, enabling the specific entropy S to be calculated. For low temperatures the nonrelativstic specific entropy is S = T/n2/3; for a relativistic Maxwellian distribution a relativistically correct expression for S = S(T,n) is derived and used. The outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit local midnight (n ∼ 3 × 10−4 cm−3 and T ∼ 140 keV) and the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail (n ∼ 1 × 10−4 cm−3 and T ∼ 50 keV) statistically have the same specific entropy. Hence the two populations are probably the same. This implies adiabatic transport (1) from the magnetotail to the dipole (where the magnetotail electrons are the source of the outer electron radiation belt) or (2) from the dipole to the magnetotail (where the magnetotail electrons are leakage from the radiation belt).},

Of special concern has been the inner edge of the inner radiation belt due to its steep gradient. We have constructed dose models of the inner edge of the belt from all three spacecraft and put them into a personal computer utility, called APEXRAD, that calculates dose for user-selected orbits. The variation of dose for low altitude, circular orbits is given as a function of altitude, inclination and particle type. Dose-depth curves show that shielding greater than similar to 1/4 in Al is largely ineffectual for low altitude orbits. The contribution of outer zone electrons to low altitude dose is shown to be important only for thin shields and to have significant variation with magnetic activity and solar cycle.

High-altitude measurements, such as those from the Van Allen Probes, provide detailed wave measurements at a few points in the magnetosphere. But physics-based models of radiation-belt dynamics require knowledge of the global distribution of chorus waves. We demonstrate that time-dependent, global distributions of near-equatorial chorus wave intensities can be inferred from low-Earth-orbit (LEO) measurements of precipitating low-energy electrons. We compare in situ observations of near-equatorial chorus waves with LEO observations of precipitating electrons and derive a heuristic formula that relates, quantitatively, electron precipitation fluxes to chorus wave intensities. Finally, we demonstrate how that formula can be applied to LEO precipitation measurements and in situ Van Allen Probes wave measurements to provide global, data-driven inputs for radiation belt models.},

abstract = {We present a statistical study of relativistic electron counts in the electron radiation belt across a range of drift shells (L{\textgreater}4) combining data from nine combined X-ray dosimeters (CXD) on the global positioning system (GPS) constellation. The response of the electron counts as functions of time, energy and drift shell are examined statistically for 67 solar wind stream interfaces (SIs); two-dimensional superposed epoch analysis is performed with the CXD data. For these epochs we study the radiation belt dropouts and concurrent variations in key geophysical parameters. At higher L we observe a tendency for a gradual drop in the electron counts over the day preceding the SI, consistent with outward diffusion and magnetopause shadowing. At all L, dropouts occur with a median time scale of {\~{}}=7 h and median counts fall by 0.4-1.8 orders of magnitude. The central tendencies of radiation belt dropout and recovery depend on both L and energy. For {\~{}}=70 per cent of epochs Sym-H more than -30 nT, yet only three of 67 SIs did not have an associated dropout in the electron data. Statistical maps of electron precipitation suggest that chorus-driven relativistic electron microbursts might be major contributors to radiation belt losses under high-speed stream driving.},

abstract = {To construct models for hazard prediction from radiation belt particles to satellite electronics, one should know temporal behavior of the particle fluxes. We analyzed 11-year variation in relativistic electron flux (E{\textgreater}2 MeV) at geosynchronous orbit using measurements made by GOES satellites during the 23rd sunspot cycle. As it is believed that electron flux enhancements are connected with the high-speed solar wind streams and ULF or/and VLF activity in the magnetosphere, we studied also solar cycle changes in rank order cross-correlation of the outer radiation belt electron flux with the solar wind speed and both interplanetary and on-ground wave intensity. Data from magnetometers and plasma sensors onboard the spacecraft ACE and WIND, as well as magnetic measurements at two mid-latitude diametrically opposite INTERMAGNET observatories were used. Results obtained show that average value of relativistic electron flux at the decay and minimum phases of solar activity is one order higher than the flux during maximum sunspot activity. Of all solar wind parameters, only solar wind speed variation has significant correlation with changes in relativistic electron flux, taking the lead over the latter by 2 days. Variations in ULF amplitude advance changes in electron flux by 3 days. Results of the above study may be of interest for model makers developing forecast algorithms. ?? 2013 IAA.},

abstract = {Bi-Maxwellian fits are made to energetic-electron flux measurements from seven satellites in geosynchronous orbit, yielding a number density (n) and temperature (T) description of the outer electron radiation belt. For 54.5 spacecraft years of measurements the median value of n is 3.7 104 cm3, and the median value of T is 148 keV. General statistical properties of n, T, and the 1.11.5 MeV flux F are investigated, including local-time and solar-cycle dependencies. Using superposed-epoch analysis where the zero epoch is convection onset, the evolution of the outer electron radiation belt through high-speed-stream-driven storms is investigated. The number-density decay during the calm before the storm, relativistic-electron dropouts and recoveries, and the heating of the outer electron radiation belt during storms are analyzed. Using four different triggers (sudden storm commencement (SSC), southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) portions of coronal mass ejection (CME) sheaths, southward-IMF portions of magnetic clouds, and minimum Dst) a selection of CME-driven storms are analyzed with superposed-epoch techniques. For CME-driven storms, only a very modest density decay prior to storm onset is found. In addition, the compression of the outer electron radiation belt at the time of SSC is analyzed, the number-density increase and temperature decrease during storm main phase are characterized, and the increase in density and temperature during storm recovery phase is determined. During the different phases of storms, changes in the flux are sometimes in response to changes in the temperature, sometimes to changes in the number density, and sometimes to changes in both. Differences are found between the density-temperature and flux descriptions, and it is concluded that more information is available using the density-temperature description.},

At the same time the fluxes of particles in Earth's radiation belts even during geomagnetically quiet conditions experience mid- and long-term variations within several orders of magnitude. Therefore using the existing static empirical models of Earth's radiation belts to estimate radiation conditions in spacecraft orbits is not always appropriate.
For that reason Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics of Moscow State University (SINP MSU) is developing a system of small spacecraft for operative (close to “real time”) monitoring of radiation conditions in the near-Earth's space.

For placing satellites into orbit it is planned to take advantage of accompanied launch by “Soyuz” rocket with “Frigate” upper stage developed by NPO Lavochkin, for example during launch of main payload into “Molniya”-type orbit. Alternatives are using the light-class space rocket or rising from LEO by using compact electric rocket engine.

abstract = {The Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope Integrated Little Experiment (REPTile) is a loaded-disc collimated solid-state particle telescope designed, built, tested, and operated by a team of students at the University of Colorado. It was launched onboard the Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE), a 3U CubeSat, from Vandenberg Air Force Base on September 13th, 2012, as part of NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program. REPTile takes measurements of energetic particles in the near-Earth environment. These measurements, by themselves and in conjunction with larger missions, are critical to understand, model, and predict hazardous space weather effects. However, miniaturizing a power- and mass-hungry particle telescope to return clean measurements from a CubeSat platform is extremely challenging. To overcome these challenges, REPTile underwent a rigorous design and testing phase. This paper highlights some of the design and testing which validates the data as a valuable contribution to the study of space weather. CSSWE uses a keep-it-simple design approach to minimize risks associated with low budget and student built missions. A coherent testing plan confirmed that the spacecraft would remain healthy and take reliable measurements in orbit. This paper also highlights the system-level design and testing that verified spacecraft performance pre and post launch. Despite the risks inherent CubeSat missions, REPTile to date has returned over 300 days of valuable science data, more than tripling its nominal mission lifetime of 90 days. Initial in-flight instrument results are presented, including engineering hurdles encountered in receiving and processing the data. Also, the preliminary scientific contributions of the mission are covered in this paper to demonstrate the capabilities of a low-budget CubeSat mission. As an affordable, robust, and simple instrument and mission design, CSSWE demonstrates that small satellites are a reliable p- atform to deliver quality science.},

abstract = {The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-series (GOES-R) is the next block of four satellites to follow the existing GOES constellation currently operating over the Western Hemisphere. Advanced spacecraft and instrument technology will support expanded detection of environmental phenomena, resulting in more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings. Advancements over current GOES capabilities include a new capability for total lightning detection (cloud and cloud-to-ground flashes) from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), and improved cloud and moisture imagery with the 16-channel Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). The GLM will map total lightning activity continuously day and night with near-uniform storm-scale spatial resolution of 8. km with a product refresh rate of less than 20. s over the Americas and adjacent oceanic regions in the western hemisphere. This will aid in forecasting severe storms and tornado activity, and convective weather impacts on aviation safety and efficiency. In parallel with the instrument development, an Algorithm Working Group (AWG) Lightning Detection Science and Applications Team developed the Level 2 (stroke and flash) algorithms from the Level 1 lightning event (pixel level) data. Proxy data sets used to develop the GLM operational algorithms as well as cal/val performance monitoring tools were derived from the NASA Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) instruments in low Earth orbit, and from ground-based lightning networks and intensive prelaunch field campaigns. The GLM will produce the same or similar lightning flash attributes provided by the LIS and OTD, and thus extend their combined climatology over the western hemisphere into the coming decades. Science and application development along with preoperational product demonstrations and evaluations at NWS forecast offices and NOAA testbeds will prepare the forecasters to use GLM as soon as possible after the planned launch and checkout of GOES-R in late 2015. New applications will use GLM alone, in combination with the ABI, or integrated (fused) with other available tools (weather radar and ground strike networks, nowcasting systems, mesoscale analysis, and numerical weather prediction models) in the hands of the forecaster responsible for issuing more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the modeling of local acceleration and loss processes in the outer radiation belt. We begin by reviewing the statistical properties of waves that violate the first and second adiabatic invariants, leading to the loss and acceleration of high energy electrons in the outer radiation belt. After a brief description of the most commonly accepted methodology for computing quasi-linear diffusion coefficients, we present pitch-angle scattering simulations by (i) plasmaspheric hiss, (ii) a combination of plasmaspheric hiss and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, (iii) chorus waves, and (iv) a combination of chorus and EMIC waves. Simulations of the local acceleration and loss processes show that statistically, the net effect of chorus waves is acceleration at MeV energies and loss at hundreds of keV energies. The combination of three-dimensional (3D) simulations of the local processes and radial transport show that the complexity of the behavior of the radiation belts is due to a number of competing processes of acceleration and loss, and depends on the dynamics of the plasmasphere, ring current, and solar wind conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {As part of a study funded by NASA MSFC to assess thecontribution of secondary particles in producing radiation damage to optoelectronics devices located on the International Space Station (IS), Monte Carlo calculations have been made to predict secondary spectra vs. shielding inside ISS modules and in electronics boxes attached on the truss (Armstrong and Colborn, 1998). The calculations take into account secondary neutron, proton, and charged pion production from the ambient galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) proton, trapped proton, and neutron albedo environments. Comparisons of the predicted neutron spectra with measurments made on the Mir space station and other spacecraft have also been made (Armstrong and Colborn, 1998). In this paper, some initial results from folding the predicted neutron spectrum inside ISS modules from Armstrong and Colborn (1998) with several types of radiation effects response functions related to electronics damage and astronaut-dose are given. These results provide an estimate of the practical importance of neutrons compared to protons in assessing radiation effects for the ISS. Also, the important neutron energy ranges for producing these effects have been estimated, which provides guidance for onboard neutron measurement requirements.},

While originally analysed in terms of dose equivalent using the NCRP-38 definition of quality factor, for the purposes of this paper the measured neutron data have been reanalyzed and are presented in terms of ambient dose equivalent. Dose equivalent rate for neutrons {\textless}1 MeV ranged from 0.80 ??Sv/d on the low altitude, low inclination STS-41B mission to 22.0 ??Sv/d measured in the Shuttle's cargo bay on the highly inclined STS-51F Spacelab-2 mission. In one particular instance a detector embedded within a large hydrogenous mass on STS-61 (in the ECT experiment) measured 34.6 ??Sv/d. Dose equivalent rate measurements of neutrons {\textgreater}1 MeV ranged from 4.5 ??Sv/d on the low altitude STS-3 mission to 172 ??Sv/d on the ???6 year LDEF mission. Thermal neutrons ({\textless}0.3 eV) were observed to make a negligible contribution to neutron dose equivalent in all cases. The major fraction of neutron dose equivalent was found to be from neutrons {\textgreater}1 MeV and, on LDEF, neutrons {\textgreater}1 MeV are responsible for over 98{\%} of the total neutron dose equivalent. Estimates of the neutron contribution to the total dose equivalent are somewhat lower than model estimates, ranging from 5.7{\%} at a location under low shielding on LDEF to 18.4{\%} on the highly inclined (82.3??)

Also, fission foils are used to detect fast neutrons. In the second method, fast neutrons are recorded by nuclear photographic emulsions (NPE). The results of measurements on board various satellites are presented. The neutron flux density does not appear to correlate clearly with orbital parameters. Up to 50{\%} of neutrons are due to albedo neutrons from the atmosphere while the fluxes inside the satellites are 15-20{\%} higher than those on the outside.

Passive detection methods mentioned include track-etch, luminescent, nuclear emulsion, and metal foil detectors. These can provide a reliable source of data for all types of radiation, but often require processing that cannot occur in space. Experimental methods of LET determination using TLDs, such as the high temperature peak ratio (HTR) method, are also discussed. Portable readout passive detectors including Pille, MOSFET, and bubble detector systems provide a novel alternative to traditional passive detectors, but research is more limited and their widespread use has yet to be established. Active detectors including DOSTEL, CPDS, RRMD-III, TEPC, R-16, BBND, and the Liulin series are examined for technical details. These instruments allow the determination of dose in real-time, and some can determine LET of incident particles by measuring energy deposition over a known path-length, but size and power consumption limit their practical use for dosimetry. Improved neutron dosimetry and development of a small active or portable readout personnel dosimeter capable of accurate LET determination are important steps for managing the effects of long-term exposure to the space radiation environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 COSPAR.

abstract = {Context: The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) has been measuring the radiation environment on the surface of Mars since August 6th 2012. MSL-RAD is the first instrument to provide detailed information about charged and neutral particle spectra and dose rates on the Martian surface, and one of the primary objectives of the RAD investigation is to help improve and validate current radiation transport models. Aims: Applying different numerical transport models with boundary conditions derived from the MSL-RAD environment the goal of this work was to both provide predictions for the particle spectra and the radiation exposure on the Martian surface comple-menting the RAD sensitive range and, at the same time, validate the results with the experimental data, where applicable. Such validated models can be used to predict dose rates for future manned missions as well as for performing shield optimization studies. Methods: Several particle transport models (GEANT4, PHITS, HZETRN/OLTARIS) were used to predict the particle flux and the corresponding radiation environment caused by galactic cosmic radiation on Mars. From the calculated particle spectra the dose rates on the surface are estimated. Results: Calculations of particle spectra and dose rates induced by galactic cosmic radiation on the Martian surface are presented. Although good agreement is found in many cases for the different transport codes, GEANT4, PHITS, and HZETRN/OLTARIS, some models still show large, sometimes order of magnitude discrepancies in certain particle spectra. We have found that RAD data is helping to make better choices of input parameters and physical models. Elements of these validated models can be applied to more detailed studies on how the radiation environment is influenced by solar modulation, Martian atmosphere and soil, and changes due to the Martian seasonal pressure cycle. By extending the range of the calculated particle spectra with respect to the experimental data additional information about the radiation environment is gained, and the contribution of different particle species to the dose is estimated.},

abstract = {We consider in a classical formulation the interaction of a particle of charge Z1e incident at a given impact parameter with an electron bound isotropically and harmonically to the origin with a frequency $\omega$. Using a perturbation expansion that assumes that the displacement of the bound electron is small compared to the impact parameter, and integrating over the impact parameter from some minimum value to infinity, we are led to an expression for the stopping power. The leading term in this expansion is proportional to (Z1e2)2 and is the usual result for this type of model, while the second term gives us the (Z1e2)3 correction. The Z13 correction for the Lenz-Jensen statistical model for the atom is presented. The predictions of this theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.},

abstract = {Research indicates that the impact to human tissues from radiation exposure is strongly related to the LET (linear energy transfer) of the particles and particles with high LET (≥ 5 KeV / $\mu$ m water) dominate the damage. High LET radiation in LEO (low Earth orbit) is composed mainly of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), solar energetic particles, particles trapped in the SAA (South Atlantic Anomaly), and albedo neutrons and protons scattered from the Earth's atmosphere. So far the active personal dosimeters are not available and the best passive personal dosimeters currently applied to the radiation assessment for astronauts are CR-39 detectors (for the high LET part) in combination with thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs) or optically stimulated luminescence detectors) (OSLDs) (for the low LET part). LET spectra for radiation in LEO were determined with CR-39. This paper introduces the operational principles for CR-39 detectors, describes the method of LET spectrum using CR-39 and presents the results measured with CR-39 and TEPC (tissue equivalent proportional counter) for space mission ISS-Expedition 2, STS-108, STS-112, ISS-7S, STS-114 and STS-121.},

abstract = {The radiation field in low Earth orbit (LEO) and deep space is complicated. The radiation impact on astronauts depends strongly on the particles' linear energy transfer (LET) and is dominated by high LET radiation. Radiation risk is a key concern for human space flight and can be estimated with radiation LET spectra measured for the different organs of an astronaut phantom. At present the best passive personal dosimeters used for astronauts are thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) for low LET and CR-39 plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) for high LET. CR-39 PNTDs, TLDs and OSLDs were used for the MATROSHKA-1 experiment to measure radiation experienced by astronauts outside the international space station (ISS). LET spectra and radiation field quantities (differential and integral fluence, absorbed dose and dose equivalent) were measured for the different organs and skin locations of the MAROSHKA phantom using CR-39 PNTDs and TLDs. The spectra and results can be used to determine the radiation quantities for astronaut's extra vehicular activity (EVA) and for the further in-depth study of the radiation risk for astronauts. Sensitivity fading of CR-39 detectors was observed for the MATROSHKA experiment and a practical method was developed to correct it. This paper presents the radiation LET spectra measured with CR-39 PNTDs and the total radiation quantities combined from results measured with CR-39 PNTDs and TLDs.},

It serves to implement "geometry trees" which correspond to the hierarchy of volumes a detector geometry can be composed of, and to allow to identify the position of individual solids, as well as to describe the materials they are made of. Being pure XML, GDML can be universally used, and in particular it can be considered as the format for interchanging geometries among different applications. In this paper we will present the current status of the development of GDML. After having discussed the contents of the latest GDML schema, which is the basic definition of the format, we will concentrate on the GDML processors. We will present the latest implementation of the GDML "writers" as well as "readers" for either Geant4 , or ROOT ,},

Outside CERN, among various applications worldwide, FLUKA serves as a core tool for the HIT and CNAO hadron-therapy facilities in Europe. Therefore, medical applications further impose stringent requirements in terms of reliability and predictive power, which demands constant refinement of sophisticated nuclear models and continuous code improvement.

abstract = {Measurements of radiation exposures aboard manned space flights of various altitudes, orbital inclinations and durations were performed by means of passive radiation detectors, thermoluminescent detectors (TLD's), and in some cases by active electronic counters. The TLD's and electronic counters covered the lower portion of the LET (linear energy transfer) spectra, while the nuclear track detectors measured high-LET produced by HZE particles. In Spacelab (SL-1), TLD's recorded a range of 102 to 190 millirad, yielding an average low-LET dose rate of 11.2 mrad per day inside the module, about twice the dose rate measured on previous space shuttle flights. Because of a higher inclination of the SL-1 orbit (57?? versus 28.5?? for previous shuttle flights), substantial fluxes of highly ionizing HZE particles were also observed, yielding an overall average mission dose-equivalent of about 135 millirem, about three times higher than measured on previous shuttle missions. A dose rate more than an order of magnitude higher than for any other space shuttle flight was obtained for mission STS-41C, reflecting the highest orbital altitude to date of 519 km. ?? 1984.},

We performed the first steps to reverse-engineering Google Scholar's ranking algorithm and present the results in this research-in-progress paper. The results are: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Therefore, highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that have been cited less often. As a consequence, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for finding standard literature than gems or articles by authors advancing a new or different view from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. Moreover, the occurrence of a search term in an article's title seems to have a strong impact on the article's ranking. The impact of search term frequencies in an article's full text is weak. That means it makes no difference in an article's ranking if the article contains the query terms only once or multiple times. It was further researched whether the name of an author or journal has an impact on the ranking and whether differences exist between the ranking algorithms of different search modes that Google Scholar offers. The answer in both of these cases was "yes". The results of our research may help authors to optimize their articles for Google Scholar and enable researchers to estimate the usefulness of Google Scholar with respect to their search intention and hence the need to use further academic search engines or databases.},

abstract = {The results presented in this paper come from an exploratory study of 19,379 mind maps created by 11,179 users from the mind mapping applications ‘Docear' and ‘MindMeister'. The objective was to find out how mind maps are structured and which information they contain. Results include: A typical mind map is rather small, with 31 nodes on average (median), whereas each node usually contains between one to three words. In 66.12{\%} of cases there are few notes, if any, and the number of hyperlinks tends to be rather low, too, but depends upon the mind mapping application. Most mind maps are edited only on one (60.76{\%}) or two days (18.41{\%}). A typical user creates around 2.7 mind maps (mean) a year. However, there are exceptions which create a long tail. One user created 243 mind maps, the largest mind map contained 52,182 nodes, one node contained 7,497 words and one mind map was edited on 142 days.},

abstract = {In many physics experiments where calorimeters are employed, the requirement of an accurate energy measurement is accompanied by the requirement of very high hadronelectron discrimination power. Normally the latter requirement is achieved by designing a high-granularity detector with sufficient depth so that the showers can fully develop. This method has many drawbacks ranging from the high number of electronic channels to the high mass of the detector itself. Some of these drawbacks may in fact severely limit the deployment of such a detector in many experiments, most notably in space-based ones. Another method, proposed by our group and currently under investigation, relies on the use of scintillation detectors which are sensitive to the neutron component of the hadron showers. Here a review of the current status will be presented starting with the simulations performed both with GEANT4 and FLUKA. A small prototype detector has been built and has been tested in a high-energy pion/electron beam behind a "shallow" calorimeter. Results are encouraging and indicate that it is possible to enhance the discrimination power of an existing calorimeter by the addition of a small-mass neutron detector, thus paving the way for better performing astroparticle experiments. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Google Scholar is one of the major academic search engines but its ranking algorithm for academic articles is unknown. We performed the first steps to reverse-engineering Google Scholar's ranking algorithm and present the results in this research-in-progress paper. The results are: Citation counts is the highest weighed factor in Google Scholar's ranking algorithm. Therefore, highly cited articles are found significantly more often in higher positions than articles that have been cited less often. As a consequence, Google Scholar seems to be more suitable for finding standard literature than gems or articles by authors advancing a new or different view from the mainstream. However, interesting exceptions for some search queries occurred. Moreover, the occurrence of a search term in an article's title seems to have a strong impact on the article's ranking. The impact of search term frequencies in an article's full text is weak. That means it makes no difference in an article's ranking if the article contains the query terms only once or multiple times. It was further researched whether the name of an author or journal has an impact on the ranking and whether differences exist between the ranking algorithms of different search modes that Google Scholar offers. The answer in both of these cases was "yes". The results of our research may help authors to optimize their articles for Google Scholar and enable researchers to estimate the usefulness of Google Scholar with respect to their search intention and hence the need to use further academic search engines or databases.},

abstract = {Space radiation dosimetry presents one of the greatest challenges in the discipline of radiation protection. This is a result of both the highly complex nature of the radiation fields encountered in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and interplanetary space and of the constraints imposed by spaceflight on instrument design. This paper reviews the sources and composition of the space radiation environment in LEO as well as beyond the Earth's magnetosphere. A review of much of the dosimetric data that have been gathered over the last four decades of human space flight is presented. The different factors affecting the radiation exposures of astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are emphasized. Measurements made aboard the Mir Orbital Station have highlighted the importance of both secondary particle production within the structure of spacecraft and the effect of shielding on both crew dose and dose equivalent. Roughly half the dose on ISS is expected to come from trapped protons and hal f from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). The dearth of neutron measurements aboard LEO spacecraft and the difficulty inherent in making such measurements have led to large uncertainties in estimates of the neutron contribution to total dose equivalent. Except for a limited number of measurements made aboard the Apollo lunar missions, no crew dosimetry has been conducted beyond the Earth's magnetosphere. At the present time we are forced to rely on model-based estimates of crew dose and dose equivalent when planning for interplanetary missions, such as a mission to Mars. While space crews in LEO are unlikely to exceed the exposure limits recommended by such groups as the NCRP, dose equivalents of the same order as the recommended limits are likely over the course of a human mission to Mars. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
